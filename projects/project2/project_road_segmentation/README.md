# Project Road Segmentation
## Overview
The aim of this project is to be able to classify patches of satellite images and tell if they correspond to roads or correspond to background. To accomplish this task we propose 3 neural network architectures implemented using the framework [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org). Specifically we are using the high-level API Keras.   

This repository contains all the files required to train the architectures, generate their history plots and run the best model with its optimum weights.  
## Setup
As the architectures are complex, it is recommended to use a computer with a GPU able to communicate with tensorflow. We are going to explain the setup for NVDIA GPUs supporting CUDA which is a parallel computing platform that allows to use the GPU for general purpose processing. However, if a GPU cannot be used, we propse an alternative setup using Google Colab.

To check if your GPU supports CUDA go to the following link: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.

## Setup for GPU-CUDA enabled computers
1. Download and install the latest version of [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for the corresponding Python 3.7 according to your OS.
2. Create a Python environment by opening a terminal (in Linux or MacOs or an Anaconda prompt shell in Windows) and running the following command `conda create --name <replace-name-of-env>`.
3. Activate the Python environment with the command `conda activate <replace-name-of-env>`.
4. Open the link [TensorFlow's installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) and follow them.

After following these steps you should have tensorflow ready to go.

### Packages installation
Don't close the terminal with the environment yet! We need to install additional packages

## Usage





For this choice of project task, we provide a set of satellite images acquired
from GoogleMaps. We also provide ground-truth images where each pixel is labeled
as road or background.

Your task is to train a classifier to segment roads in these images, i.e.
assigns a label `road=1, background=0` to each pixel.

Submission system environment setup:

1. The dataset is available from the
[CrowdAI page](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation).

2. Obtain the python notebook `segment_aerial_images.ipynb` from this github
folder, to see example code on how to extract the images as well as
corresponding labels of each pixel.

The notebook shows how to use `scikit learn` to generate features from each
pixel, and finally train a linear classifier to predict whether each pixel is
road or background. Or you can use your own code as well. Our example code here
also provides helper functions to visualize the images, labels and predictions.
In particular, the two functions `mask_to_submission.py` and
`submission_to_mask.py` help you to convert from the submission format to a
visualization, and vice versa.

3. As a more advanced approach, try `tf_aerial_images.py`, which demonstrates
the use of a basic convolutional neural network in TensorFlow for the same
prediction task.
